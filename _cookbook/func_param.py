Function Parameters Cookbook.

Function Argument Annotations (Python 3).
    
    The Python interpreter does not attach any semantic meaning to the attached
    annotations. They are not type checks, nor do they make Python behave any
    differently than it did before. However, they might give useful hints to
    others reading the source code about what you had in mind. Third-party
    tools and frameworks might also attach semantic meaning to the annotations.
    
    Although you can attach any kind of object to a function as an annotation
    (e.g., numbers, strings, instances, etc.), classes or strings often seem to
    make the most sense.
    
    Function annotations are merely stored in a functionâ€™s `__annotations__`
    attribute.
    
    For example:

        def f(x:int, y:int) --> int:
            return x + y

    The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in
    the defining scope only once.

    **NOTE**: When the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary,
    or instances of most classes, and if you don't want the default to be
    shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this
    instead.
